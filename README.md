This project visualizes the risks of state-led mass killings around the world. It is part of the <a href="https://www.earlywarningproject.org/">Early Warning Project</a>, an initiative to warn governments, advocacy groups, and at-risk societies of mass atrocities early. The interactive charts featured in this project allow users to view each country's statistical risk assessment and the variables that go into it. Risk assessments are averages of forecasts from three models: Bad Regime, Elite Threat, and Random Forest. These models represents different ideas about the origins of mass atrocities, and are developed from historical data that compare cases where state-led mass killings occurred to ones where they didnâ€™t. Users can explore the values each country takes on for the variables comprising those models, and the percentile ranking of those values compared to all countries across all years included in the dataset. 

Countries included are those with populations above 500,000.

## About This Visualization

This interactive visualization is created with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The JavaScript libraries used are <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. The project is hosted with <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/-/about">bl.ocks.org</a>, which is a viewer for code hosted on <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a>. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/drewleonard/ewp-risk">GitHub repository</a> to learn more about the code. This project uses the <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized color palette</a> for most elements.

## Data Sources

This visualization leverages publicly available data collected and analyzed by the Early Warning Project. The data is updated annually, and risk assessments reflect each country's risk of a state-led mass killing during the current year. The data comes from the following sources:

* <a href="https://github.com/ulfelder/earlywarningproject-statrisk-replication">The Early Warning Project</a>
* <a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/">Center for Systemic Peace</a>
